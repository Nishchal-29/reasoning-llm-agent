# reasoning-llm-agent

This project presents **reasoning-llm-agent**, an Agentic AI system created for the Saptang Labs Machine Learning Challenge to address the common failure of Large Language Models in multi-step reasoning tasks.  
The system works by decomposing complex logic questions into a sequence of simpler sub-tasks.  
It then autonomously selects and executes the appropriate tool, such as a calculator or code interpreter, for each step.  
This modular approach ensures accuracy and produces a transparent, human-readable reasoning trace for each final answer.
